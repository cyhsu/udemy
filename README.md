   Udemy: What I have learned 
================================

   I had been took Udemy courses coupled years ago; however, since I didn't originize my learning notes well. 
   Lot's of the course content disappeared when I graduated from Texas A&M University.   

   This is the reason why I decide to once I recall my courses, I will upload what I have done with Jupyter Notebook. 
   By this, I believe it helps me to recover my memories back soon once I need to do this again, and give me an oppotunity to 
   use the info to teach students.
